# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview :

Jack has asked us to make some updates to the PlanMyTrip app, based on feedback from beta testers. We will be using APIs from OpenWeather and Google Maps to provide weather descriptions, create a personal travel itinerary, and show travel route information between multiple cities.

Using these APIs, we have implemented several new features in the app. Customers can now input their preferred temperature range and see a heat map of cities that meet their criteria. The map also shows the locations of nearby lodgings. Additionally, users can now create an itinerary and find the closest hotel to their destination. These updates should greatly enhance the usefulness and convenience of the PlanMyTrip app for our users.
